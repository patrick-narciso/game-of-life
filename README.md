### Structure

When accessing some application page, the **router** (In this case, the application only has `<App />` as an entry point) identifies this **page** and assembles its elements for the user.

Every **page** is made up of a set of **resources** that allow user interaction through its layouts. When the user interacts with a **layout**, an action must be triggered.

**Actions** can perform 2 types of tasks: some backend integration and making state changes.

All backend integration must be carried out by a **service**. A service can be exclusive to some functionality, or it can also be shared among several.
